# Notes

- Get answer to part one/two by running `python day-5 -m p1` or `p2`
- `file.read()` works for this relatively small file size, but I would do another implementation if the files got much bigger.
- There might be a nicer way to preserve crate order in part two that doesn't rely on a temporary data structure, but I couldn't think of one that used `deque`
