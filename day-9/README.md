# Notes

* This one took me way too long, but came together pretty quickly once I found out about `math.copysign`.
* The `next_move` function is pretty janky. There should be a nicer way to do this.
* Running `python day-9.py -m p2` will generate a graphic of the knot moving with the moves from the second test input from the Advent of Code website.
